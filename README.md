In this project in python, we’ll build a classifier to train on 80% of a breast cancer histology image dataset. Of this, we’ll keep 10% of the data for validation. Using Keras, we’ll define a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**, call it CancerNet, and train it on our images. We’ll then derive a confusion matrix to analyze the performance of the model.

IDC is Invasive Ductal Carcinoma; cancer that develops in a milk duct and invades the fibrous or fatty breast tissue outside the duct; it is the most common form of breast cancer forming 80% of all breast cancer diagnoses. And histology is the study of the microscopic structure of tissues.

**Breast Cancer Classification – Objective**

To build a breast cancer classifier on an IDC dataset that can accurately classify a histology image as benign or malignant.
**What is Deep Learning?**

An intensive approach to Machine Learning, Deep Learning is inspired by the workings of the human brain and its biological neural networks. Architectures as deep neural networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and deep belief networks are made of multiple layers for the data to pass through before finally producing the output. Deep Learning serves to improve AI and make many of its applications possible; it is applied to many such fields of computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, and drug design.

**What is Keras?**

Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is a high-level API and can run on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, and Theano. Keras is all about enabling fast experimentation and prototyping while running seamlessly on CPU and GPU. It is user-friendly, modular, and extensible.
